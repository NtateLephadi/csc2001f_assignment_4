# csc2001f_assignment_4
This assignment concerns using directed graphs to develop a simulation of an emergency medical ervice; of ambulances, hospitals, and medical emergencies.  Hospitals have emergency units.  Ambulances are stationed at hospitals.  The road network that connects hospitals and victim locations can be modelled with a weighted directed graph.  Emergency calls are received from victims at particular locations.  Ambulances must be routed to victims and then on to hospitals. (An ambulance can only take a victim to the hospital at which it is stationed.) Part one of the assignment will be automatically marked, while part two will be manually marked.
